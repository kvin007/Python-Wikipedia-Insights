# Tranzact Coding Challenge

The challenge consists on identifying wikimedia urls based on the current hour and "n" past hours, downloading those compressed files and making a report based on the decompressed data.

This repository is based on the [Kenneth Reitz's repo](https://github.com/navdeep-G/samplemod) for structuring a Python repository.

## Instructions

```python
docker build -t wiki_insight .
